I encountered an error when trying to retrieve news for GOLD using the OpenAI news API. It seems like there were no news articles found for that ticker on the specified date. Since I can't access news data, I'm unable to provide a comprehensive analysis of social media posts, sentiment, and recent news for GOLD. I need news data to proceed with the analysis.
