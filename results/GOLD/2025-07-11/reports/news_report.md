It appears there was an error retrieving macroeconomic news using the OpenAI API. Additionally, no news results were found for the query "GOLD" in Google News for the specified date. I will proceed without those news sources.

Since I couldn't retrieve any news, I am unable to provide a comprehensive report of the current state of the world relevant for trading and macroeconomics related to GOLD. I cannot provide any trading advice at this time.
