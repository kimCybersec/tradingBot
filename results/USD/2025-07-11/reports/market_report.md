The analysis of USD from 2024-07-11 to 2025-07-11 reveals several key trends and potential trading signals.

**Trend Analysis:**

*   **Long-Term Trend (200 SMA):** The 200-day SMA is currently at 58.47 and has been generally increasing from 39.33 a year ago, indicating a long-term upward trend. However, the rate of increase has slowed down recently, suggesting the long-term uptrend may be losing steam.
*   **Medium-Term Trend (50 SMA):** The 50-day SMA is at 58.83 and also generally increasing from 61.94 a year ago, but is showing signs of leveling off or potentially declining. This suggests that the medium-term uptrend is also weakening.
*   **Short-Term Trend (10 EMA):** The 10-day EMA is at 73.95, significantly above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. This indicates a strong short-term upward momentum. However, because the 10-day EMA is above both the 50 day and 200 day SMA, this suggests that the price may be overbought in the short term and may soon reverse.

**Momentum:**

*   **MACD:** The MACD line (5.28) is above the signal line (4.96), indicating bullish momentum. However, the MACD value has decreased slightly from the previous days, suggesting that the bullish momentum might be slowing.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is at 74.14, indicating overbought conditions. This suggests that the price may be due for a pullback.

**Volatility:**

*   **ATR:** The ATR is at 2.89, indicating moderate volatility.

**Volume-Weighted Average Price:**

*   **VWMA:** The VWMA is at 71.46, which is close to the current price, suggesting that the current price is in line with the average price paid by investors, taking volume into account.

**Trading Signals and Considerations:**

1.  **Overbought Conditions:** The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback in the short term.
2.  **Slowing Momentum:** While the MACD is still positive, its decreasing value suggests that bullish momentum is waning.
3.  **Weakening Medium and Long Term Trends:** The 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA suggest that the medium and long term trends may be losing steam.
4.  **Short Term Momentum:** The 10 day EMA is significantly above the 50 and 200 day SMA, suggesting that the price may be overbought in the short term.

**Indicators Selection Rationale:**

*   **close\_200\_sma, close\_50\_sma, close\_10\_ema:** These moving averages provide a comprehensive view of long-term, medium-term, and short-term trends.
*   **macd, macds:** MACD and its signal line are used to gauge momentum and potential crossovers for trading signals.
*   **rsi:** RSI is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **atr:** ATR is used to measure the volatility of the stock.
*   **vwma:** VWMA is used to confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data.
